UWP-011 - Laudable Layout Challange

1. Use only a Grid control.
2. I used the designer of a 5: Phone 1920x1080 300% scale.
3. The large textblck's size is 48 points.
4. Most of the margins are either 10 or 20 pixels.
5. The TextBlocks for FirstName, Last Name and Email should be centered verticall in the row.

6. Tricky: You'll need to figure out how to allow your TextBlock to span multiple columns(Hint: Use Intellisense!)
