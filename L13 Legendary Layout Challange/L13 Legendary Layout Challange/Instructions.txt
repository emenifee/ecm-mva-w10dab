UWP-013 - Legendary Layout Challange

Use only StackPanel controls.
I use the Designer of a 13.3 Desktop (1280x720) 100% Scale.
The large textblock's size is 48 points.
The left-most textblock is 250 pixels wide
The second textblock is 500 pixels wide.
Get the text from the LoremIpsom.txt file.
The third area is 300 pixels wide.
Most of the margins are either 10 or 20 pixels.
Youll need to use the TextWrapping propery of the TextBlocks.
